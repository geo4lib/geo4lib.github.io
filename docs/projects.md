# Projects 

Geo4Lib serves as a hub for a range of collaborative projects focused on managing geospatial resources in libraries. These efforts span software development, metadata standards, documentation, and discovery tools.

Some projects are led within the Geo4Lib community, while others are developed independently or as part of allied initiatives, such as the IIIF community. Geo4Lib highlights and supports these efforts by providing shared space for discussion, feedback, and connection.

Each project sets its own goals and timeline, while staying linked through community meetings, shared infrastructure, and annual events. This model encourages open participation, collective ownership, and room for new ideas to emerge.

## Related & Affiliated Projects

These projects are independently developed or part of other communities, but many of their contributors participate in Geo4Lib conversations, and we often discuss or collaborate on their development and use in library contexts.

- ### IIIF for Maps  
  A working group within the [IIIF Community](https://iiif.io) focused on extending IIIF protocols and viewers to support maps and geospatial resources. Topics include georeferencing, annotations, coordinate transformations, and display strategies for tiled map content.  
  https://iiif.io/community/groups/maps/

- ### Allmaps  
  A georeferencing platform built on IIIF. Allmaps enables easy georeferencing of historical maps using drag-and-drop tools and interoperable APIs. Although developed independently, Allmaps is widely used in libraries and often discussed in Geo4Lib.
