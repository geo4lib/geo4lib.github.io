## Monthly Community Meetings

Geo4Lib Community Meetings take place on the second Wednesday of each month. These informal, open meetings are a chance to share updates, ask questions, and hear what others are working on.

## Community Sprints

We host virtual sprints twice a year, typically in Winter and Summer. These are collaborative work weeks where participants focus on specific projects, issues, or ideas. While inspired by traditional code sprints, Geo4Lib Sprints often include work on documentation, metadata standards, governance, and other community needs.

Anyone is welcome to participate, regardless of technical background.


## Geo4LibCamp

Geo4LibCamp is an annual hands-on meeting for anyone interested in how libraries can manage and support the use of maps and spatial data. The main focus is to share best-practices, solve common problems, address technical issues, and plan for the future of geospatial librarianship. For the purposes of the camp, we broadly define geospatial resources from scanned maps and aerial photography to highly structured shapefiles.
