# Introducing Geo4Lib: A new chapter for collaboration

A new chapter is unfolding in the world of library-based geospatial communities! 

Introducing: **Geo4Lib**! 

<!-- more -->

## Why this community matters

Geo4Lib exists because the technical side of geospatial librarianship needs a space where we can focus on tools, data, metadata, platforms, and infrastructure.



At the same time, we recognize how easy it is for open-source software development to charge ahead without input from the people who rely on these tools every day. One of our core values is to actively challenge that tendency by working to bridge conversations across roles: developers, librarians, curators, educators, practitioners, and anyone invested in making geospatial collections more discoverable. If you are working at the intersection of libraries, maps, and technology, we welcome you here.


## From GeoBlacklight to Geo4Lib: evolving and expanding

Geo4Lib is both a continuation and a reinvention. You might consider it a rebrand of the GeoBlacklight Community, but that is only part of the story. We are expanding our scope by bringing together several overlapping groups into a single, more inclusive space. 

However, we are not starting from scratch. *Geo4Lib* as an ongoing community is an evolution of *Geo4LibCamp*, the long-running unconference, and going forward, we are putting even more energy into that event. In fact, we will be celebrating the 10th Geo4LibCamp next year, and for the first time, it is heading to Austin, Texas!

We are also more strongly centering OpenGeoMetadata as a core project, as it has several exciting developments underway, like a new metadata API and a lightweight viewer.

## Connecting projects

Geo4Lib intentionally creates space for adjacent communities & projects to participate that might be under the governance of other programs. If you are working on something geo-related that could benefit from broader reach, better interoperability, or just a larger network of collaborators, please consider joining our events and communication spaces!

Finally, we are not just building tools; we are building connections. If you have ever felt like the geo-library tech world was hard to break into or overly siloed, Geo4Lib is here to change that.

##  A new role

On a personal note, I recently stepped down as the longtime community coordinator for GeoBlacklight. This transition coincides with the BTAA Geospatial Information Network charting a new direction for our Geoportal. 

But stepping back from one role has opened the door to a new one: I have taken on a one-year term as Geo4Lib's inaugural co-chair, alongside Alex Marden from the University of Texas. I am feeling energized by our collective decision to bring several overlapping projects together under one umbrella and to see what we can build together!
