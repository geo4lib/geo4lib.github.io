Participants in the Geo4Lib community come from a variety of professional and intellectual backgrounds (including librarians, software developers, metadata specialists, applied researchers, and others).

Anyone interested in spatial data infrastructures, libraries, GIS, maps, data curation, open source software, and related topics, is welcome to join us. Depending on their skills and interests, participants contribute to the community in any number of ways (for instance, by attending meetings, writing documentation, developing metadata best practices, engaging in outreach, and writing code).
